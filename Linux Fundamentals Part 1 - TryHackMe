# 🐧 TryHackMe — Linux Fundamentals Part 1

In **Linux Fundamentals Part 1**, I explored the foundational concepts and hands-on skills needed to begin working confidently in a Linux environment.

 🔹 Key Concepts & Commands Learned

 1. Deploying and Accessing a Linux Machine
- Learned how to deploy and connect to a Linux machine in TryHackMe.

 2. Basic Commands
- echo — Outputs any text or variable provided.  
- whoami — Displays the username of the currently logged-in user.

 3. Navigating the Filesystem
- ls — Lists all directories and files in the current location.  
- cd — Changes directories; used to move between folders or return to the home directory.  
- pwd — Prints the full path of the current working directory.  
- cat — Displays the content of a file directly in the terminal.

 4. Searching for Files and Data
- find — Searches for files by name or pattern.  
  Example: `find / -name "*.txt"` finds all files ending with `.txt`.  
- grep — Searches for specific text or patterns within files.  
- wc -l access.log — Counts the number of lines (entries) inside `access.log`.

 5. Shell Operators
- & — Executes a command in the background.  
- && — Chains multiple commands (runs the next only if the previous succeeds).  
- > — Redirects command output to a file, overwriting its contents.  
- >> — Appends command output to the end of a file instead of overwriting it.

 🧠 Recap

By completing this module, I learned to:

- Understand why Linux is widely used in IT and cybersecurity.  
- Interact confidently with a Linux terminal.  
- Run and combine essential commands to manage files and directories.  
- Use tools like **`find`** and **`grep`** to efficiently locate information.  
- Enhance commands using **shell operators** for better automation and control.
